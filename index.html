            <p>Hello! I'm Zoe Collins. I've been programming since a summer camp when I was 12 that introduced me to Scratch, and from
                there kept digging into everything I could get my hands on. My goal in life is to show the world what I've loved 
                doing since I was a kid, and show loud and proud just what women in STEM can accomplish!
            </p>
            <p>I began my formal programming education at Cleveland State University, later moving on to The Ohio State University, 
                pursuing Computer Science at both of those universities. With already having self-taught interests in programming,
                college just never seemed like a good fit for me. I was later introduced to The Ohio State Unviersity coding bootcamp
                which seemed much more my style of hands-on apply what you know education. That's lead me to where I am today!
            </p>
            <p>I've worked in many languages, including: Java, C#, Lua, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, with almost all of those having 
                been applied to a software developer co-op through Emerson Electric. I am confident that I can make my mark wherever I 
                may end up, and hope that my projects below can give a little taste of what I'm capable of.
            </p>
